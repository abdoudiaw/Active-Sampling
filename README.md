# Active-Sampling
The repository shows an active learning method based on finding critical points on a response surface using optimizier.
The algorithm is implemented in Mystic by Mike McKerns. Here we have a couple of tests cases: benchmark functions, anaylitcal functions for plasma transport, and finally an objective function using mystic.
